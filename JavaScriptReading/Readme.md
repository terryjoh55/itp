# Javascriptreading
## Chapter 1

1. Calculations are always precise unless it cannot be precisely expressed as a decimals like pie. So always be aware of it and treat fractional digital numbers as approximations
2. The signs in arithmetic in Javascript is called operations
3. NAN stands for not a number. (like 0/0)
4. Character after a back slash means something in Javascript. For example, n means new lines and strings cannot be added. They can only be concatenated (meaning they can only be linked in chains or series
5. Three-character comparison operations like === or !== should be used to prevent unexpected type conversions.
6. When the operator is applied to the wrong type of value, Javascript will quietly convert that value to the type it needs.

### Please ignore this because I read the instructions wrong. I thought it was 6 observations for each chapter.

## Chapter 1:

One thing I knew: In arithmetics, we can use parentheses to change the order of calculations.

One thing I did not know: We need to use operations to combine or transform values.

## Chapter 2:

One thing I knew: Keywords may not be used as binding names. In class, Professor Rome told us that special words could not be used as passwords. 

One thing I did not know: We can create loops instead of logging all the individual digits.

## Chapter 3:

One thing I knew: Thereâ€™s no need to feel bad when writing functions that are not pure. Because I was told that I should not feel bad when I am wrong.. (I am sorry I know nothing in this chapter)

One thing I did not know: We could grow and recur functions. And recurring is not the same as looping. Growing functions on the other hand is more of adding and renaming the functions.
